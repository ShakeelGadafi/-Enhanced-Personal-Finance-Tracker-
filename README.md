# -Enhanced-Personal-Finance-Tracker-
This script allows users to manage their transactions, including adding, viewing, updating, and deleting transactions, as well as displaying a summary of their financial activities.

Here's a brief overview of how to use the application:

Add Transaction: Users can add a new transaction by providing details such as amount, category (e.g., groceries, rent), type (income or expense), and date.

View Transactions: Users can view all existing transactions, categorized by their respective categories. Each transaction includes details such as transaction ID, amount, type, and date.

Update Transaction: Users can update an existing transaction by providing the transaction ID and entering new details for amount, category, type, and date.

Delete Transaction: Users can delete a transaction by providing its transaction ID.

Display Summary: This option provides a summary of the user's financial activities, including total income, total expenses, and the balance (income minus expenses).

Exit: Users can exit the program, and any changes made will be saved automatically.

To use this script, you can copy it into a Python file (e.g., finance_tracker.py) and run it using a Python interpreter (python finance_tracker.py). Ensure that you have transactions.json file in the same directory to store transaction data.

For educational purposes, you might want to include additional comments throughout the code to explain each function's purpose and how it works. Additionally, it's always a good idea to test the application thoroughly to ensure it behaves as expected.
